    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a classic pasta dish built around tender chicken, rich cream sauce, and pasta coated evenly in a smooth, savory finish. It is known for its simplicity and heavy, comforting texture rather than complex spice or acidity.</p>
    <p>The dish starts with seasoned chicken breast, typically pan-seared until lightly browned and fully cooked, then sliced or cubed. The Alfredo sauce is made by gently simmering butter, heavy cream, and garlic, creating a thick base that is finished with grated Parmesan cheese. As the cheese melts, the sauce becomes creamy and cohesive, clinging to the pasta instead of pooling at the bottom.</p>
    <p>Fettuccine is the most common pasta choice due to its wide, flat shape, which holds the sauce well. Once cooked, the pasta is tossed directly into the sauce along with the chicken, allowing everything to combine evenly. Black pepper and a touch of salt are used to balance the richness without overpowering it.</p>
    <p>The final result is a dense, creamy pasta dish with mild flavors, high fat content, and a protein-forward profile. It is often served on its own or paired with simple sides like garlic bread or steamed vegetables to cut through the richness.</P>

  <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the fettuccine according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve a small amount of pasta water, then drain.</li>
      <li>Season the chicken with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil or butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the chicken until golden on both sides and fully cooked. Remove from the pan and slice.</li>
      <li>Lower the heat to medium. In the same skillet, melt butter and add garlic. Cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Pour in the heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir occasionally and cook for 3&ndash;5 minutes until slightly thickened.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to low and gradually stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked pasta and sliced chicken to the sauce. Toss to coat evenly, adding a small amount of reserved pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.</li>
      <li>Season with additional salt and black pepper as needed. Serve immediately, optionally garnished with parsley or extra Parmesan.</li>
