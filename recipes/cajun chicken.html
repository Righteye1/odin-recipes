  <p> Baked Cajun chicken is a straightforward oven-roasted dish built around bold seasoning and minimal prep. Chicken breasts or thighs are coated in a blend of Cajun spices, olive oil, and garlic, then baked until juicy inside with a lightly crisp exterior.</p>
  <p>The Cajun seasoning brings layered heat and smokiness, typically combining paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, thyme, salt, and black pepper. As the chicken bakes, the spices bloom in the oil, forming a flavorful crust while the meat stays tender.</p>
  <p>This recipe is designed for simplicity and consistency. Everything cooks in one pan, making it easy to prepare for weeknight dinners or meal prep. The finished chicken pairs well with rice, roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a simple starch that balances the spice.</p>
  <p>The result is a high-protein, oven-friendly dish with strong flavor, low effort, and flexible sides.</p>
